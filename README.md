# java-based-Password-Generator
Console-based Java application for generating secure passwords using customizable criteria


## Project Description
The Java Password Generator is a console-based application that generates secure and random passwords based on user-defined criteria. The project demonstrates the use of Java programming and object-oriented principles to solve a real-world security problem by creating strong passwords and evaluating their strength.

Weak passwords are a common cause of security breaches. This application helps users generate strong passwords by allowing customization of password length and character types, ensuring better security practices.


## Objectives
- To generate random and secure passwords using Java
- To allow users to customize password length and character composition
- To evaluate password strength based on multiple parameters
- To apply object-oriented programming concepts in Java


## Features
- User-defined password length  
- Option to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols  
- Secure password generation using `SecureRandom`  
- Password strength evaluation (Very Weak, Weak, Medium, Strong, Very Strong)  
- Simple and interactive console-based interface  


## Technologies Used
- Java  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- SecureRandom class  
- Regular Expressions
